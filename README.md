# Julia-Set

The Julia function that creates the Julia Set. It allows you to specify a number of parameters including Real and Imaginary Axis, Julia-set constant, and more.

The AnimatedJuliaSet code sweeps through and makes a movie of multiple Julia sets by adjusting the imaginary part of the Julia-set constant. It can create both an on-screen animation as well as a .avi file. The code is highly adjustable to user inputs via a dialogue box.
